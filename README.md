### Campaign Donations Table

A simple table using the `donations_over_5K.json`. The data contains all campaign donations over $5,000 filed with the Missouri Ethics Commission. 

We'll use this in class to load a couple of libraries that will make this table more interesting and useable.

* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)

I (Shelby) pushed to add my own in class work on 8 March.
